          I created SnapScetch because I kept noticing the same issue among many
          artists: it’s hard to stay consistent with practice. Not because of a
          lack of motivation — but because there’s always something in the way.

          Choosing the right references, finding time, deciding where to start...
          This site is an attempt to make practice more accessible and structured.

          It doesn’t teach you how to draw, doesn’t save your results, and doesn’t
          judge you (at least not yet 😉). But it gives you what’s often missing —
          a clear push to action: here’s an image, here’s a timer — draw.
        </p>
        <p>
          SnapScetch is made for those who want to train, not procrastinate.

          Whether these features happen depends on one thing — if this tool
          turns out to be truly useful to others. I don’t see SnapScetch as a
          “product.” I see it as a habit — one that’s easy to stick with 🎯
